Analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends
## Overview of Porject
## Purpose
During this project, we have come to analyze data on previous Kickstarter campaigns to better accurately gauge future campaigns. It is centered around campaigns in certain countries and with certain parameters. Included with the data set are reports on the outcome and is the relationships between specific launch dates and how they aligned with the fundraising goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis 

Using the data provided in the table, we were able to create this pivot table demonstrating Theater Outcome by the Launch Date.

We used a filter to analyze data specific to what was asked. Filters like being able to find out the specific category really helped narrow down the data. 

By using variations of the COUNTIF Formula and applying absolute cell references, we were able to count all data that met specific criteria accurately

### Challenges

Some formulas we're quite time consuming which proved absolute cell references very usefull throughout the entire analysis of the structured Data.
 
## Results

### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Dates

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
#### Most Successful month for campaigns were in May, June and July
There are more campaigns launched in those three months indicating the increase number of overall failures.

### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Dates
#### The least successful month to launch campaigns seems to have been in December
Had almost the same number of failed vs successful campaigns

### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Dates

### Outcome Based on Goals
#### Campaigns with a fundraising goal between $5,000 and $9,999  had the highest rate of success. 

### Summary of Limitations and Recommendations 

#### limitations of this Data set
Data seems cluttered and some could have been omitted to make the process more streamlined. Some data seems also outdated.
##### Other Possible Tables 
You could create a table that analyzes relationships between backers and the amount of money raised. Some campaigns with less backers than others ended up being a success.
